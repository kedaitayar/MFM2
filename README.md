The plan for this project is to rewrite MFM v1 that will include more technology that is missing from the previous project and overall do a better job at coding and organising the project.

Currently the project has implemented the following:
 - 
 - Hilt (Dependency injection)
 - Navigation Component (Single Activity design)
 - Room (Local database)
 - Dao instrument test (Automated testing)
 - Custom view (UI)
 - Material Design (UI and Theme)
